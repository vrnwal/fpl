# Fantasy Premier League Analysis & Modelling
In this repository, I analyze Premier League Statistics from the 2019-20 season to aid me in making a decision for my FPL team for next season, which is something I am very interested in. 
To do so, I use data that has been sourced from the github repository, https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League. The data comprises office data from the Fantasy Premier League website, along with data from the statistical analysis website, understat.
